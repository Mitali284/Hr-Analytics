# Hr-Analytics

I feel happy to share my second project to share my 2nd project as a data analyst intern at MeriSKILL.
This project was on the attrition rate of employees with respect to various dimensions of work and social life.
In this project, I built four dashboards Demographics, Turnover Analysis 1, 
Turnover Analysis 2 and Employee Wellness.

Tools used:
Microsoft Excel: used Excel to clean and transform the data.
PowerBI: used PowerBI to build dashboards and identify trends.

Task: 
Data Cleaning: 
• Deleting redundant columns. 
• Renaming the columns. 
• Dropping duplicates. 
• Cleaning individual columns. 
• Remove the NaN values from the dataset 
 

Data Visualization: 
• Plot a correlation map for all numeric variables Overtime 
• Marital Status 
• Job Role 
• Gender 
• Education Field 
• Department 
• Business Travel 
• Relation between Overtime and Age 

Key insights:

Total Employee count: 1470
Current Employee count: 1233
Attrition count: 237

Demographics:
1. The attrition rate was higher among males as compared to females.
 Male attrition percentage: 63%
 Female attrition percentage: 37%
2. The attrition count with respect to the marital status. The single had the highest count followed by married and divorced.
3. The strange thing that data revealed was that the people who had good work-life balance contributed more than 50% of attrition.
4. Overall the attrition percentage was 16%.
5. People from the Life Sciences education field had the highest number of attrition which was 89.

Turnover Analysis:
1. Attrition with respect to job roles was very high in Laboratory Technicians followed by Sales Executive and Research Science. And the attrition was dominated by males.
2. The attrition rate by the department was highest in Research and Development at 56% followed by Sales at 39% and Human Resources at 5%.
3. Employees who were new had a high attrition rate as compared to the experienced professionals. Job positions such as entry-level had a high attrition rate.
4. Employees who had low-performance ratings had a higher attrition rate of 84% compared to high-performance ratings of 16%.
Employee Wellness:
1. The attrition count of the satisfied and very dissatisfied people was the highest at 73 and 66.
2. The attrition count of people with moderate job involvement was the highest at 125. Which is more than 50%.
3. Attrition count with respect to Relationships the employees who were satisfied and very satisfied had the highest attrition rate.
Recommendations:
1. Males seem to dominate attrition with over 63% of attrition. Therefore, measures should be taken to see what makes them uncomfortable.
2. Employees with low performance ratings have more than 80% attrition rate therefore the recruitment should be done with high integrity and through testing of candidates.
